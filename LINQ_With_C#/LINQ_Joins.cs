        //Join: This operator is used to join two data sources or collections based on common property and
        //return the data as a single result set.

        //or property but returns the result as a group of sequences.

        //Inner Join: The Inner Join is used to return only the matching rows from both the data sources involved
        //in the join by removing the non-matching records.

        //Left Outer Join: The LEFT OUTER JOIN is used to retrieve all the matching rows from both the data sources
        //involved in the join as well as non-matching rows from the left side data source. In this case,
        //the un-matching data will take a null value.

        //Right Outer Join: The RIGHT OUTER JOIN is used to retrieve all the matching rows from both the data
        //sources involved in the join as well as non-matching rows from the right-side data source.In this case,
        //the un-matching data will take NULL values.

        //Full Outer Join: The Full Outer Join is used to retrieve all the matching rows as well as all the
        //non-matching rows from both the data sources involved in the JOIN. The non-matching data in such cases
        //will take the NULL values.

        //Cross Join: In Cross Join, each record of a data source is joined with each record of the other data source.
